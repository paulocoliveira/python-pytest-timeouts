## :question: What is this Repository about?

- This repo contains example code of using **Python Pytest Timeouts**, including an automated test case using Selenium Webdriver on LambdaTest Cloud platform.
- This project uses Pytest framework to run the tests.

## :question: More about timeouts...
In the realm of test automation, timeouts play a vital role in ensuring test stability and avoiding test failures caused by unforeseen delays or unresponsive components. By setting appropriate timeouts, we can control the maximum duration a test is allowed to run or wait for a specific condition. This helps in maintaining test efficiency, detecting potential issues promptly, and preventing tests from hanging indefinitely.


## Running the Code

To run any of the scripts from command line use the following command:
```bash
python 01-waiting-for-element-visibility.py
```

## Running the Cloud Grid Sample

By default, the test would be running on LambdaTest Platform on Chrome and Firefox Browsers, and on Windows 11 and MacOS.

As a prerequisite for this code, you need:
1. Download and Install Python

2. Download and Install Visual Studio Code

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code

4. Enter in the cloud-grid folder
```bash
cd cloud-grid
```

5. Install pytest, and Selenium WebDriver libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to run this cloud grid sample, please run the command below in the project folder:
```bash
pytest
```
